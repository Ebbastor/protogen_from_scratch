# Ebbastor's Protogen from Scratch

This protogen is (I believe) Hong Kong's first protogen made from scratch.

I know it sounds quite vain of me to say so, but I have at least checked across the relevant communities.

I would like to share the source files for the sake of recording what I did and let everyone use my design as a reference point for everyone's maker journey. It's not perfact, but I know it's mine.

This uses an ESP32 DevKit DOIT v1 as the main controller, connected with 16P IDC Cables for the LED Panels, and a screw terminal for LED Power. This is all powered by a 5V PD3.0 Trigger.
